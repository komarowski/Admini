## Overview

[Medeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medeu) is the highest open stadium in operation. It sits 1691 meters above sea level. Medeu is the most visited sports complex in Kazakhstan as it can be easily reached by city bus or taxi.

## My experience

I have been here many times but have never gone ice skating. For me, this is more of a very convenient starting point for many popular mountain routes.

Not far from the skating rink there is a mudflow protection dam 110 meters high. It offers a breathtaking view of the surroundings. Therefore, it is a very popular place for selfies.
